# My debug checklist

## Why I created this debugging checklist repo
As a former marketing and communications professional turned developer, I noticed something interesting during my transition into tech: while I was good at spotting issues and seeing things from a user's perspective, my approach to debugging needed... a bit of structure.
Coming from a non-technical background, I can sometimes become overwhelmed and panicked when something in the code base I'm working on breaks. It's no good! 

Some of the patterns that I've begun to recognise in myself that show I'm moving into panic mode are:
- Quickly jumping to conclusions before gathering all the evidence
- Experiencing stress responses when facing complex technical issues such as headaches, nausea, and insecurity.
- Moving from curiosity into taking a "throw everything at the wall" approach to problem-solving
- Feeling anxious about not understanding "simple technical concepts" (like how to read the network tab in the browser dev tools!)
- Confusion.

This checklist emerged after a terrible day of going around in circles, being defeated by 'bugs', and feeling down and out on myself. I decided to turn yet another moment of feeling worthless into an opportunity to appreciate that I'm still growing in this tech career - and help myself keep growing here too. I think they call this making lemondade baby!

I am proud of this checklist because it encourages a systematic and curious approach to debugging - with a side of mindfulness that I brought in from my yoga teacher training. I find it hard to think straight when I'm not in my body, so creating time for check-ins and pauses for mindful awareness is incredibly helpful. I can't believe I haven't put more conscious effort into weaving practices like this throughout my work process earlier. 

I think it's worth saying that this checklist isn't about having all the answers. It's about combining process with emotional awareness and self-compassion. It's a tool to help me center myself and a path to follow so I don't get lost in my head and can communicate clearly when I need help.  I know it sounds dramatic. But I think that's just my human experience. I love it all the same.
 
If you think a checklist like this could help you too, feel free to copy mine as a template and share :)
